ABOUT UPDATING OLDER VERSIONS OF THE OLDSCHOOL FONT PACK TO V2.2

Upgrading from v2.1:

    Simply install/replace the fonts you need (keep in mind that older 'Plus'
    fonts have been updated - see released note)

Upgrading from v2.0:

    Nothing major to do here; the only fonts that should be removed are
    "Olivetti MxVGA", "DG One Alt", "DG One Alt-2y" (see release notes for
    v2.1).  The rest can be overwritten.

Upgrading from v1.x:

    If you have any fonts from v1.x of the pack installed on your systems, I
    *strongly recommend* removing all older "Bm" and "Px" fonts before you
    install any from v2.1.  Quite a few fonts have been renamed or have
    changed roles, so keeping the older versions will leave you with
    duplicates and with an inconsistent set.
