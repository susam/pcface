PC Face JavaScript API Documentation
------------------------------------

PC Face is a collection of programmer friendly resources for drawing
CP437 characters on a graphical canvas.

This project also offers some JavaScript functions to consume the
bitmaps and plot pixels on an HTML5 canvas to render the CP437 glyphs.

Visit [PC Face module documentation](module-pcface.html) to see the
documentation of these functions.
